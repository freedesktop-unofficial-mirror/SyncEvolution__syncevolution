SyncEvolution Graphical User Interface for Moblin

 * Running
 
 Syncevolution D-Bus service must be either running or installed
 properly (so DBus autostart works). the client itself must be installed
 so gtkbuilder xml file and rc style file get found.  
 
 
 * Bugs
 
   - There is an initial flicker when windows are shown.
     This is probably a MuxBin initialization problem.

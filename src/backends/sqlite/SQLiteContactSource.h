/**
 * Uses SQLiteUtil for contacts with a schema inspired by the one used
 * by Mac OS X.  That schema has hierarchical tables which is not
 * supported by SQLiteUtil, therefore SQLiteContactSource uses a
 * simplified schema where each contact consists of one row in the
 * database table.
 *
 * The handling of the "N" and "ORG" property shows how mapping
 * between one property and multiple different columns works.
 *
 * Properties which can occur more than once per contact like address,
 * email and phone numbers are not supported. They would have to be
 * stored in additional tables.
 *
 * Change tracking is done by implementing a modification date as part
 * of each contact and using that as the revision string required by
 * TrackingSyncSource, which then takes care of change tracking.
 *
 * The database file is created automatically if the database ID is
 * file:///<path>.
